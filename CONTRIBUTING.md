## Before Submitting a Pull Request

Before you submit a pull request you should first discuss the change via an issue in the repository.

## Pull Request Requirements

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to list of emojis.

## Image Standards

The image should be a PNG sized at 128x128px with a transparent background. The content of the image should take up as much space as possible, these files are going to be small on the server so we want to use all the canvas.
